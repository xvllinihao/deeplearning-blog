# Spatially-sparse convolutional neural networks reproduction blog

This blog documents the reproduction efforts to the paper "Spatially-sparse convolutional neural networks" by Benjamin Graham. The reproduction project is conducted as part of the course Deep Learning course (CS4240) at TU Delft.

In this blog, we will briefly explain the architecture of the DeepCNet and the existing available code related to this paper ([link](https://github.com/btgraham/SparseConvNet)). As the existing code implements the spatially-sparse convolutional neural network with ResNet or VGG, we tried to make modifications to it to reproduce the DeepCNet as proposed in the paper. We applied the parameters used in the paper to see if the results can be reproduced, and we also adjusted the original parameters to see if there exists any performance improvement.
